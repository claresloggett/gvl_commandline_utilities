These scripts will configure commandline utilities on this server.
They will:
  - create environment modules for Galaxy Toolshed tools
  - install and configure RStudio Server
  - configure IPython Notebook for secure web access
  - set up public_html directories
A new non-sudo account called 'researcher' will be created to use these utilities.

==================================================================================

This instance has now been configured with a non-sudo account called researcher.
You should use this account for non-admin tasks.

To get started straight away, log out as user ubuntu and log back in as user
researcher, and examine the README.txt file in your new home directory:

  less README.txt

Or, if you would like to use su right now rather than logging out, we suggest
the following as a workaround to allow you to use screen in your new account:

  su - researcher
  script /dev/null
  less README.txt
