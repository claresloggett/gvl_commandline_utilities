# Write out required NGINX config structure, and create SSL certificates.
# Must be run with superuser permissions.
# We are setting up prerequisites for:
#  - RStudio server forwarding, which can be configured in /usr/nginx/conf/rstudio_nginx.conf
#  - public_html forwarding for any number of users, which can be configured in /usr/nginx/conf/public_html.conf
#  - IPython Notebook forwarding to /ipython for a single notebook instance running on port 9510.
# More complex Notebook setups can be configured depending on your number of users using
# either open ports, or a more complex convention for NGINX location forwarding.
# This default config just handles a single Notebook instance which may be run by any
# user and will appear at HTTPS location /ipython .
#
# We assume that lines
#   include commandline_utilities_http.conf;
# and
#   include commandline_utilities_https.conf;
# are already at the correct locations in /usr/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
